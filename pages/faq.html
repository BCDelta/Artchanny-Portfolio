                        MagicaVoxel is a free voxel-editing software created by ephtracy. Compatible with both Windows and MAC OS,
                        MagicaVoxel offers users the ability to create voxel assets and/or voxel scenes with ease. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aspect that separates the program from others is the "interactive path tracing renderer," which offers beautiful lighting 
                        effects. The program also supports the ability to create key-frame animations to create animated 
                        voxel scenes.

                        Start by downloading the program by clicking <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/">here</a>.
                        Download the latest verision to stay up to date with the latest updates.

                    <p>
                        Once installed, go ahead and start experimenting by creating your own scenes! If you ever need help, I offer
                        numerous tutorials on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ArtChanny97">YouTube</a> channel regarding MagicaVoxel's 
                        fundementals and tools.

                        Start small and make assets or scenes you are familiar with. I would advise staying away from 256<sup>3</sup>
                        voxel-sized scenes until you become familiarized with the program. Google images and references are your friend. Use them 
                        intelligently, to aid you, not inhibit you.

                        What are some things you would've done differently if you could re-learn MagicaVoxel?

                        I would've stuck with my original idea and completed the project to finish. I wasted quite a lot of time during my 
                        learning phases starting voxel scenes then scrapping it shortly later. This created a kind of an artist's-block where 
                        I wasn't really sure what I wanted to make.

                        What is your work progress when creating voxel scenes?

                        If I wanted to make for instance a sci-fi scene, I would look up sci-fi images, both in voxel-form and concept art.

                    <p>
                        After that, I would put on some ambiant music to play in the background to get me in the mood to help me create the 
                        scene I want.
