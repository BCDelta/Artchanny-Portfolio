                a Patreon, and offer commissions on Fiverr? Here you would find access to all the links I am associated with.

            <h2>INSTAGRAM</h2>
            <p>I started out my voxel-art journey with Instagram back in 2019. I had received a drawing tablet for my birthday
                from my friends and decided to pursue digital-art. Initially, the posts were just of me posting my 
                progress and some small projects I did for fun. However, the account really start to grow in 2020 when I 
                posted a small voxel bathroom I made in Magicavoxel. I shifted my art-medium over to voxel-art and have
                been enjoying it ever since.
